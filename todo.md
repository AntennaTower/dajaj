- you can get the up to 10 players with the `players` endpoint, this will get their matches too
- then you can send requests for ALL of their matches and get the matches where they are all in the game
- aggregate the data and cache it. the good thing is that the matches endpoint is not rate limited and doesn't need an API key so no worries about that
